Some useful code for working with machine learning techniques in C#

## Background
In the summer of 2016, I completed Andrew Ng's excellent introduction to Machine Learning course on Coursera.
It was also my first introduction to Octave/MATLAB, which made light work of many of the calculations involved.

After the course, I looked around for C# libraries so I could apply the techniques on a platform that was more
familiar to me. There are some pretty good ones out there! Even so, I thought it would be a great exercise to
try and implement my own. The intention is not to compete with any of the established libraries, but to practice
my own coding skills, and probably blog about it now and then.
